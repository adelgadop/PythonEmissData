# PythonEmissData
This repository contents Jupyter Notebooks files useful to process information related to `fleet features`, `use intensity` and `road length`.

`fleet features` and `use intensity` are processing in *Fleet and Use intensity.ipynb*. There are details about how we can process information to get useful data to feed to `wrfchemi_cbmz_fc.ncl` based on emissions pre-processor model [Andrade et al. 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2015.00009/full). Here, I'm considering emission factors based on field experiment, mainly by [PÃ©rez-Martinez et al. (2014)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13762-014-0562-7) and by [Andrade et al. 2015](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2015.00009/full), shown as following:

Where `VEIC` corresponds a specific type of vehicle and his fuel use:

* Light-duty vehicles (LDV): VEIC 1 (gasohol fuel), VEIC 2 (ethanol fuel), and VEIC 3 (Flex Gasohol and Ethanol fuel).
* Heavy-duty vehicles (HDV): VEIC4A (trucks diesel fuel), VEIC4B (urban bus, diesel fuel), VEIC4C (articulated urban bus, diesel fuel).
* Motorcycle (MC): VEIC6A (gasohol fuel), VEIC6B (Flex-G and Flex-Eth fuel).
* Others: VEIC 5 that represents taxis with fuel consumption of natural gas.

The second file *Road_Length.ipynb* is useful to process the output file from QGIS in `*.csv` format to `*.txt`.
